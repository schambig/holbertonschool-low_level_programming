## Description<!--@schambig-->

C is an imperative, procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write operating system. The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, simple set of keywords, and clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programming like operating system or compiler development.

But why learn C?, here are **some** of the important advantages of learning C programming:

* **C is a Middle-Level Language**, C gives as a good opportunity to interact with hardware, It reduces the gap between the low-level and high-level languages. It can be used for writing operating systems as well as doing application level programming.
* **Helps to understand the fundamentals of Computer Theories**, Most of the theories related to computers like Computer Networks, Compiler Designing, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems are based on C programming language and requires a good knowledge of C.
* **C is very fast in terms of execution time**, Programs written and compiled in C execute much faster than compared to any other programming language.
* **It will be easier to learn other programming languages**, Because so many different programming languages are based on or related to C, your knowledge of C will simplify the process of learning other languages. These languages typically share similar syntax, operators, control statements, data types and more.
* **The structure simplifies testing and debugging**, The C programming language is a strongly typed language, meaning data structures and variables must be declared in advance. As such, the compiler is able to enforce proper usage of these declared types and catch a variety of bugs at compile-time.

This repository contains projects developed using C language.
